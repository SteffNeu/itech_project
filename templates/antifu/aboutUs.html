        There is a lot of hateful content on different social media platforms. It goes from simple word vomit to extremly insulting and hurtful attacks. This makes the internet a toxic place. Cyberbullying is a rising problem and the reports of teenagers and adults alike suffering from the consequences of hate on the internet are no new occurence anymore. At the same time there are also reports of people standing up to that hate, defending themselves and others, confronting haters and bullies. Those brave people can make a difference in the lives of the victims and the offenders at the same time. Confronting people with the consequences of their output can help them realize their mistakes.

        On our website we want to encourage people to share hateful content they encountered and constructivly debunk/eliminate it. ​It is in your power to bring positivity into the internet. You as a user can upload hateful content you encountered in a censored way. We ask you to censor the name of the hater and anything that could give a clue to their identity. On our website we do not want to encourage hate or encourage people being targeted.

        With this application we hope to raise awarness of how hatefulness can be fought, is presented and perceived and we hope to make the internet a little less toxic and a little bit more loveable.​
